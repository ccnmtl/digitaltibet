material: Bronze | Cotton | Silk | Stone | Wood
notes: This combined stupa and incense burner are in a Chinese style and give the
  name Gold Stupa Temple (Jinta si) to this Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the Chinese
  provincial capital of Xining. Although the combined stupa and incense burner appear
  to be made of bronze or some other non-precious metal, it was probably once covered
  in gold-leaf. Note the mix of Chinese and Tibetan material culture, such as the
  Chinese "fu" dogs with their heads tied in Tibetan kata scarves, the Tibetan Lantsa
  script and deer and wheel emblems alongside the Chinese symbol for longevity.
