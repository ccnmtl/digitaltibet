material: Cotton | Silk
notes: This blockprint on cotton is attached over a doorway. The mantra repeated on
  the textile is "Om mani padme hung" so the image is presumably that of Chenrezik,
  or Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva associated with compassion and the Dalai Lamas.
  The silken fabric hanging down in front of the woodblock print is probably a kata
  (khwa ta), which are frequently blessed by lamas. This monastery derives its name
  (Mouth of the Kata Monastery) from the fact that a kata hung from a bush spoke to
  local Tibetans, and this miracle prompted the foundation of the monastery.
