## Registered Users (Including Students in Professor Tuttle's Courses)

1. Logging in
   As a student Professor Tuttle's course, you should log in with your UNI.

2. Claiming an Object
   You are able to search the collection and "claim" an object to use for your "Object Biography" by hitting the "claim object" button. You can only claim one object. When you have claimed one, no one else in the course can claim that same object.

3. Collecting an Object
   As you go through the collection looking for interesting objects, you can "collect" them by hitting the "Add to Collection" button on the right side of the object details list.

    When you collect an object it is added to "Your Album", accessible via tab at the top of the window. The purpose of "Your Album" is to help you keep track of objects you are interested in and to help with your object biographies.

    When you collect an object, you are able to leave a note to yourself about why you are collecting it in a text field that appears.

4. Annotating a Object
   When you are examining an object, you are able to add annotations.

**IMPORTANT: For the time being, after you add or delete or edit an annotation, you MUST refresh your browser window for those changes to be visible.**

Click the "+" and "-" buttons to zoom in and out, and click "pan" to center the part of the object you are examining. Click "Add shape". The mouse icon will change to a small target. Place the target over the area of the object you wish to annotate and click once. An input field will appear. You should label the annotation with a word or two (ex. "Dragon Foot"), and then proceed to add a more detailed description in the text field. When you are done writing, click "save". Your annotation marker will stay on the image, and the annotation itself will be accessible by clicking on the saved marker.

Annotations are logged by author. You can see a list of all annotation authors, and their annotations, in the right column under "annotations". You are able to show/hide annotations by author.
